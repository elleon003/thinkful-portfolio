        <p>I'm a web developer living in Columbus, OH.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>While I've worked for years as a professional singer and arts administrator, I've always had a love for
          technology. Dubbed the unofficial office IT department (cause we didn't have one for years in the theater),
          I've
          loved figuring out the technology I use.</p>
        <p>I spent many years in a self-taught coding path, using resources like <a href="https://freecodecamp.org"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>, but I craved more connection and
          structure. I really wanted to have someone I could talk to.</p>
        <p>Recently, I took the plunge and enrolled as a student of <a href="https://thinkful.com" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">Thinkful</a>. To have a mentor to talk to, and people to chat with online all
          focused and dedicated to learning in this program has been an amazing ride.</p>
        <p>I have an insatiable desire for learning, so I'm extremely excited to fully commit to this endeavor.</p>
        <h3>What Else Do I do?</h3>
        <p>When I pull myself away from my computer, I love to pass the time by</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Hanging out with my husband and dog</li>

              <p>Matt McTeague is a licensed counselor who's plans to open his own practice accelerated in light of the
                COVID-19 crisis. With most of his ducks in a row in his professional requirements, he needed help with the
                technical side of opening his virtual doors.</p>

              <p>He wanted something simple, a space to talk about his services, provide necessary paperwork for clients,
                and have an easy way for people to contact him. While currently a static site, he has future plans to have
                a portal for his clients as well as accept payments online.</p>

                Instagram (but she's got her pics on that too!)</p>

                built with a custom designed frontend, and utilizes the WagtailCMS, a Python based CMS.</p>

              <p>We were tasked with creating a quiz web app on something we were very knowledgeable about and enjoyed. Well, I've been addicted to The Sims since 2006, and have owned every version and expansion pack released to market. So it seemed fitting to model my quiz after a longtime favorite. (And GREAT nerd showcase!)</p>

              <p>By asking the user's postal code to assess their local weather, combined with their hair pattern and length, I created an app that took that info and turns it into a curated list of YouTube hair tutorials.</p>
              <p>This one was a little close to home. Having recently changed my hair from dreadlocks to loose natural kinks, I've lost myself in a sea of tutorials for the care of my hair. While the results aren't quite as accurate as I'd like (only so much you can do with the search algorithm), it opens people up to ideas they may not have considered otherwise.</p>
